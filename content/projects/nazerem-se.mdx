# Concept & Idea

The idea is to create a simple, yet powerful, tool for creating and managing a personal knowledge base. The tool should be easy to use, and should not require any technical knowledge. It should be possible to use the tool on any device, and it should be possible to access the knowledge base from anywhere.

## Techstack

The tool is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- NextAuth
